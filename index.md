# Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

---

## Medical Image Generation
### 3D Causal-StyleGAN3 for Synthesizing MR Images of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease

During a research seminar at the Hasso-Plattner-Institute we developed a novel approach to generate images from underrepresented AD populations, including younger patients and those with less advanced disease stages.
The developed model uses a causal graph to represent the relationships between age, sex, clinical dementia rating, and brain volumes, and can intervene on these variables to generate images with specific features.

## Medical Image Segmentation
### A simulation framework for benchmarking active learning strategies for 3D medical image segmentation

[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Paper-red?logo=Arxiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00845){:target="_blank"}

During a research seminar at the Hasso-Plattner-Institute we developed an active learning benchmarking framework for scientists seeking comparability and reproducibility.
The framework is open-source and our paper was accepted at the [Adaptive Experimental Design and Active Learning in the Real World](https://realworldml.github.io/icml2022/) workshop at ICML 2022.

## Fair Compensation
### A showcase for calculating fair salary with machine learning

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-32cd32)](https://ijusttyped.github.io/fair-compensation-frontend/){:target="_blank"}

The objective of the project is to showcase how machine learning can be used to make the salary structure fair.
This may involve, for example, identifying and eliminating potential gender pay disparities, making pay increases or new hires fair.
